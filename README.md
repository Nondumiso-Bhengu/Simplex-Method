The user has to input a few things before running the code.
this code was compiled on code blocks but should run on any other gcc compiler.
The question is about tutors that are needed for a certain module. using the simplex method, we need to figure out what would be their maximum profit after working for a certain period of time.

The equation: maximize 4x1 + 5x2 + 6x3
subject to 2 constraints: 2x1 + x2 + x3 <= 180 and x1 + 3x2 + 2x3<= 300

What to input:
Maximization or minimization? (1 is for maximization & 0 is for minimization)
= 1 (enter 1)
How many variables does the LP problem have?
= 3 (enter 3)
How many conditions are there? (1 or 2)
= 1 (enetr 1)
Input the free members, use 0 for the objective function
= enter 180 then skip a line and enter 300
Enter the coefficients of the LP expressions in each line, skip spaces in between each coeeficient
= 2 1 1     1 3 2   
Is the condition greater than or less than? use 1 for greater than and 0 for less than
= 0 (enter 0)
the solution will then be found!! (the max function is = 840 & the optimal solution will be = 180)
If you want to try again, enter 1, if not, enter 0
